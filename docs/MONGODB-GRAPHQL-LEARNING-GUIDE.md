# MongoDB + GraphQL Learning Guide

## Current Setup Summary

### What You Already Have ✅

**Backend (MongoDB + Express):**

- `functions/models/user.js` - User schema with favorites
- `functions/controllers/userController.js` - Auth logic (register, login, getUser)
- `functions/express.js` - API endpoints with JWT protection
- Password hashing with `bcrypt` (10 salt rounds - secure!)
- JWT authentication with 1-hour expiration
- Protected routes for favorites

**Frontend:**

- Redux Toolkit for state management
- JWT token storage in localStorage
- Auth context for login/logout
- API integration with your backend

## Security: MongoDB vs Firebase

### MongoDB + Express (Your Current Setup)

**Security Features:**

- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds = very secure)
- ✅ JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware
- ✅ MongoDB indexes for unique emails
- ✅ Input validation in controllers
- ✅ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

**What You Control:**

- Server logic and business rules
- Database queries and indexes
- Authentication flow
- Data validation rules

**Learning Value: HIGH** - You understand how everything works

### Firebase (Old Setup)

**Security Features:**

- ✅ Google-managed security
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ✅ Real-time database
- ✅ Automatic backups

**Limitations:**

- Vendor lock-in
- Less flexible querying
- Harder to learn security concepts
- Cost increases with scale

## Recommendations for YOUR Project

### Option 1: Keep MongoDB + Express (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Learning, control, long-term projects

**Pros:**

- ✅ You already have 90% built
- ✅ Better learning experience
- ✅ Full control over security
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Can migrate to any cloud later
- ✅ Better for complex queries

**Security Improvements Needed:**

1. Add input validation (check email format, password strength)
2. Add rate limiting (prevent brute force attacks)
3. Add request size limits
4. Use environment variables for secrets
5. Consider longer JWT expiration or refresh tokens

### Option 2: Add GraphQL Layer (OPTIONAL)

**Best for:** If you want to modernize API

**Why:**

- Current REST API works fine
- GraphQL is optional, not required
- Can be added later if needed

**If you want it:**

```javascript
// Add GraphQL later if you want to learn it
// For now, REST API is simpler and works well
```

## Learning Path Recommendation

### Week 1: Understand Your Current Setup

1. Study `functions/controllers/userController.js`

   - Learn how bcrypt.hash works
   - Understand JWT token generation
   - See how password comparison works

2. Study `functions/models/user.js`

   - Learn MongoDB schemas
   - Understand how data is structured
   - See how favorites are stored

3. Test your API endpoints
   - Register a user
   - Login and get JWT token
   - Use token to access protected routes

### Week 2: Security Improvements

1. Add input validation
2. Add rate limiting
3. Review security best practices
4. Test edge cases

### Week 3: Optional - Remove Firebase

Since you're using MongoDB for everything, you can remove Firebase if you don't need it.

## Security Best Practices You Should Learn

### 1. Password Hashing (Already Done ✅)

```javascript
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
```

### 2. Password Verification (Already Done ✅)

```javascript
const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
```

### 3. Add Input Validation

```javascript
// Validate email format
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid email" });
}

// Validate password strength (8+ chars, 1 number, 1 uppercase)
const passwordRegex = /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$/;
if (!passwordRegex.test(password)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: "Password too weak" });
}
```

### 4. Add Rate Limiting

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
});

router.post("/user/login", loginLimiter, loginUser);
```

## Comparison Summary

| Feature            | MongoDB + JWT            | Firebase             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Learning**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent     | ⭐⭐ Limited         |
| **Security**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Control**        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Full Control  | ⭐⭐ Limited         |
| **Cost**           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cheap           | ⭐⭐⭐ Can Expensive |
| **Flexibility**    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Flexible | ⭐⭐⭐ Less Flexible |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ None          | ⭐⭐ High            |
| **Understanding**  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Full          | ⭐⭐ Limited         |

## My Recommendation

**Stick with MongoDB + Express** because:

1. You've already built 90% of it
2. You'll learn more and understand security deeply
3. No vendor lock-in
4. Better for career growth
5. Can optimize for your specific use case
6. Security is very good with proper setup

**Add Firebase only if:**

- You need real-time features across devices
- You want zero backend maintenance
- You're building a quick prototype

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Continue with Vite migration (already planned)
2. Study your current MongoDB setup
3. Add the security improvements listed above
4. Test everything thoroughly
5. Remove Firebase if unused

Your current setup is secure and well-architected. With the improvements above, it will be production-ready!
