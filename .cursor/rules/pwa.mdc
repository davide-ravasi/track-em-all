# PWA and Service Worker

- CRA currently registers the service worker via [src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js](mdc:src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js).
- After Vite migration, use `vite-plugin-pwa` to generate and register the SW.
- Ensure icons/manifest under `public/` remain valid ([public/manifest.json](mdc:public/manifest.json)).
