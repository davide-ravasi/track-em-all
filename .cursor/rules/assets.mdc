# Asset Handling Rules

- Assets in `public/` are referenced from root: `/logo.svg`.
- Assets in `src/` must be imported and used via the import variable.

Examples in this repo:

- Header logo should be referenced either via import from `src/assets` or via `/track-em-all.svg` if placed in `public/`.
- Avoid relative paths to `../../assets` for runtime URLs; use import instead.
